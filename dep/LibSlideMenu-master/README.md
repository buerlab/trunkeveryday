A sliding menu for Android, very much like the Google+ and Facebook apps have.
That is, this one slides the activity title / action bar out of the way as well!

Based upon the great work done by stackoverflow user Scirocco (http://stackoverflow.com/a/11367825/361413),
thanks a lot!

The XML parsing code comes from https://github.com/darvds/RibbonMenu, thanks!

Usage
=====

Menus are created in xml as normal, adding text and possibly an icon.

In the activity where you want a SlideMenu, just instantiate one and call its
show() method where appropriate, i.e. on app-icon click in action bar or on button
click. The SlideMenu constructor will require you to have the calling class implement
the SlideMenu callback to get notified about menu item clicks.

The sample activity shows how it all works.

Thanks go out to stackoverflow user scirocco (http://stackoverflow.com/users/1150188/scirocco)
whose work we just slightly extended and also to David Scott for the XML parsing code in RibbonMenu
(https://github.com/darvds/RibbonMenu) that we used to complete this implementation.
